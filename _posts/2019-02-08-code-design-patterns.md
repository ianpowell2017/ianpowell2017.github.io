## Code Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

### [Abstract Factory](https://www.dofactory.com/net/abstract-factory-design-pattern)

Creates an instance of several families of classes

#### [Builder](https://www.dofactory.com/net/builder-design-pattern)

Separates object construction from its representation

#### [Factory Method](https://www.dofactory.com/net/factory-method-design-pattern)

Creates an instance of several derived classes

#### [Prototype](https://www.dofactory.com/net/prototype-design-pattern)

A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

#### [Singleton](https://www.dofactory.com/net/singleton-design-pattern)

A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural Patterns

#### [Adapter](https://www.dofactory.com/net/adapter-design-pattern)

Match interfaces of different classes

#### [Bridge](https://www.dofactory.com/net/bridge-design-pattern)

Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation

#### [Composite](https://www.dofactory.com/net/composite-design-pattern)

A tree structure of simple and composite objects

#### [Decorator](https://www.dofactory.com/net/decorator-design-pattern)

Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

#### [Facade](https://www.dofactory.com/net/facade-design-pattern)

A single class that represents an entire subsystem

#### [Flyweight](https://www.dofactory.com/net/flyweight-design-pattern)

A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

#### [Proxy](https://www.dofactory.com/net/proxy-design-pattern)

An object representing another object


### Behavioral Patterns

#### [Chain of Responsibility](https://www.dofactory.com/net/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern)

A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

#### [Command](https://www.dofactory.com/net/command-design-pattern)

Encapsulate a command request as an object

#### [Interpreter](https://www.dofactory.com/net/interpreter-design-pattern)

A way to include language elements in a program

#### [Iterator](https://www.dofactory.com/net/iterator-design-pattern)

Sequentially access the elements of a collection

#### [Mediator](https://www.dofactory.com/net/mediator-design-pattern)

Defines simplified communication between classes

#### [Memento](https://www.dofactory.com/net/memento-design-pattern)

Capture and restore an object's internal state

#### [Observer](https://www.dofactory.com/net/observer-design-pattern)

A way of notifying change to a number of classes

#### [State](https://www.dofactory.com/net/state-design-pattern)

Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

#### [Strategy](https://www.dofactory.com/net/strategy-design-pattern)

Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

#### [Template Method](https://www.dofactory.com/net/template-method-design-pattern)

Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

#### [Visitor](https://www.dofactory.com/net/visitor-design-pattern)

Defines a new operation to a class without change
