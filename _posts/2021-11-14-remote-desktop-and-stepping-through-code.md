## Problem
The <kbd>F11</kbd> key is commonly used during a debugging session, to step through lines of code. So you can imaging the suprise when one of your most used keys fails to work as expected and oddly only when connecting to the remote machine using a **Remote desktop** connection.

## The fix
After alot of internet searching I came across this [article](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/784b2bbe-353f-412e-ac9a-193d81f306b6/remote-desktop-for-mac-f11-key-not-working-on-macbook-pro-touchbar?forum=winRDc)

I had to un-map the <kbd>F11</kbd> from showing the 'desktop' in **System Preferences** > **Keyboard** > **shortcuts** > **Show DeskTop (F11)**
