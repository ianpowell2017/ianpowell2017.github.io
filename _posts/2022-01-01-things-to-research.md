- [ ] [Rx .net](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive)
  - Using Rx, you can represent multiple asynchronous data streams (that come from diverse sources, e.g., stock quote, tweets, computer events, web service requests, etc.), and subscribe to the event stream using the IObserver<T> interface. The IObservable<T> interface notifies the subscribed IObserver<T> interface whenever an event occurs.
  - Because observable sequences are data streams, you can query them using standard LINQ query operators implemented by the Observable extension methods. Thus you can filter, project, aggregate, compose and perform time-based operations on multiple events easily by using these standard LINQ operators. In addition, there are a number of other reactive stream specific operators that allow powerful queries to be written. Cancellation, exceptions, and synchronization are also handled gracefully by using the extension methods provided by Rx.
