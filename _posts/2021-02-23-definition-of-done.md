# IS IT DONE, IS IT DONE DONE, OR IS IT DONE DONE DONE?

If you’re in the business of application development, you’ve asked that question before.  So what is the definition of done? When asking the question, it’s important to note who you are and your level in the organization. Delivery teams, program teams, and portfolio teams define done differently. What we know for sure, is that we need a clear definition of done at each level of the organization.

## DEFINITION OF DONE

The definition of done (DoD) is when all conditions, or acceptance criteria, that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted by a user, customer, team, or consuming system.  We must meet the definition of done to ensure quality.  It lowers rework, by preventing user stories that don’t meet the definition from being promoted to higher level environments. It will prevent features that don’t meet the definition from being delivered to the customer or user.

## USER STORIES

The most common use of  DoD is on the delivery team level.  Done on this level means the Product Owner reviewed and accepted the user story. Once accepted, the “done” user story will  contribute to the team velocity.  You must meet all of the defined criteria or the user story isn’t done.

### User Story DoD Examples

- Unit tests passed
- Code reviewed
- Acceptance criteria met
- Functional tests passed
- Non-Functional requirements met
- Product Owner accepts the User Story

## FEATURES

Done on this level may mean it qualifies to add to a release.  Not all user stories need to be completed. Rather, it means the feature may be sufficient to satisfy the need. Once accepted, the done feature will contribute to the release velocity.  Again, you must meet all of the defined criteria or the feature isn’t done.

### Feature DoD Examples:

- Acceptance criteria met
- Integrated into a clean build
- Promoted to higher level environment
- Automated regression tests pass
- Feature level functional tests passed
- Non-Functional requirements met
- Meets compliance requirements
- Functionality documented in necessary user user documentation

## EPICS

Done on this level may refer to a organizational strategic priority, portfolio plan item, or some other collection of features that satisfied a market need.  Not all user stories or features need to be completed. Rather, the epic may be sufficient to satisfy the need. Once accepted, the done epic will contribute to throughput calculations to see if the supply is in balance with demand.

### Epic DoD Examples:

- Non-Functional requirements met
- End-to-end integration completed
- Regression tests pass
- Promoted to production environment
- Meets defined market expectations

## SUMMARY

Just as the definition of ready is super important, so is the definition of done.  Never start work on something until you have agreed on the definition.  Be consistent. Be clear. Have a shared understanding.
