## Git Cheat Sheet for TFS Users
If you’re used to a centralized version control system like Team Foundation Server Version Control (TFVC), it can be a little tricky to make the move to Git — not because it’s all that hard — mostly because the terminology is completely different.  So, are you a TFVC user who needs to wrap your head around Git?  Here’s a little cheat sheet for you.

| TFS Version Control           	| Git                      	|
|-------------------------------	|--------------------------	|
| Workspace                     	| Repository (aka. “Repo”) 	|
| Get Latest  (First time)      	| Clone                    	|
| Get Latest (After first time) 	| Pull                     	|
| Check in                      	| Commit + Push            	|
| Check out                     	| (just start typing)      	|
| Branch                        	| Branch                   	|
| Merge                         	| Merge                    	|
| Code Review                   	| “pull request”           	|
| Shelveset                     	| Stash                    	|
| Label                         	| Tag                      	|
