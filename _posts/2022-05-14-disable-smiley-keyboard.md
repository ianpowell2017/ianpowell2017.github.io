I keep catching the <kbd>fn</kbd> or <kbd>globe</kbd> button on the mac keyboard and the smiley on-screen keyboard pops up, really annoying!

Disabling this shortcut can be accomplished by opening the System Preferences and navigating to the Keyboard panel.

From within the Keyboard tab, look for the label that reads `Press globe icon` to. It likely reads `Show Emoji & Symbols`. Click on the dropdown and choose `Do Nothing` to disable the emoji shortcut.
